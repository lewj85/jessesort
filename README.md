# JesseSort

JesseSort is a novel sorting algorithm that introduces a new data structure called a Rainbow to efficiently organize and merge elements. It achieves a runtime of O(n log n).

# Setup

To compile JesseSort, run:

`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`

Then you can import it with:

`from jessesort_c import jessesort`


# Algorithm Overview

JesseSort consists of two main phases:

1. Generating the Rainbow

2. Merging its bands

The full breakdown of the algorithm can be seen in JesseSort.pdf.
