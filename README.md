# JesseSort

JesseSort is a novel sorting algorithm that introduces a new data structure called a Rainbow to efficiently organize and merge elements. It achieves a runtime of O(n log(Hâ‚™)) â‰ˆ O(n log(ln n)), making it competitive with traditional sorting algorithms while leveraging properties of harmonic numbers for improved performance.

# Algorithm Overview

JesseSort consists of two main phases:

1. Generating the Rainbow (O(n log(1.5 Hâ‚™)))

The input array is structured into a Rainbow, a hierarchical grouping of elements that facilitates efficient merging.

This structuring is performed in O(n log(1.5 Hâ‚™)) time, leveraging properties of harmonic numbers to optimize the sorting process.

2. Merging the Rainbow Bands (O(n log(1.5 Hâ‚™)))

The bands of the Rainbow are recursively merged using a multiway merge strategy.

This merging process takes O(n log(1.5 Hâ‚™)) time, ensuring an efficient recombination of sorted elements into the final sorted output.

# Runtime Analysis

JesseSort's total runtime is the sum of its two phases:

O(n log(1.5 Hâ‚™)) + O(n log(1.5 Hâ‚™)) => O(n log(Hâ‚™))

# Understanding the Harmonic Term (Hâ‚™)

The harmonic number Hâ‚™ is approximately:

Hâ‚™ â‰ˆ ln(n) + Î³

where Î³ â‰ˆ 0.577 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Substituting this into the runtime:

O(n log(1.5 ln(n)))

This shows that JesseSort has a slightly improved complexity over traditional O(n log n) sorting algorithms, particularly for large n.

# Algorithm

JesseSort's efficiency comes from its use of the Rainbow structure, which optimizes the merging process by leveraging harmonic growth properties.

# Usage

To use JesseSort, import the `jessesort()` function:
